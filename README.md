ðŸ˜  Hate Speech Detection using Deep Learning
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on classifying tweets into one of three categories: Hate Speech, Offensive Language, or Neither. The project uses a Deep Learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras to perform this sequence classification task.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to build an effective and robust model that can automatically detect and flag harmful content on social media platforms. By classifying tweets, we can help create safer online environments. The solution involves a complete end-to-end pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
